This is a work in progress to provide an easy to use graphical user interface for data exploration and analysis.

The goal is to make statistical tools more accessible to biological scientists. Not only to enhance their research, but to provide a richer understanding of statistics.

NOTE: There are currently some app breaking bugs in the code. These will be addressed with time...
